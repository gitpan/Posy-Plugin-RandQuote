==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::RandQuote - Posy plugin to give a random quote from a file


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.40'' of Posy::Plugin::RandQuote.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

Sticks a random quote from a file into the body of the entry. This replaces
a string in the format of <!--quote(*filename*)--> with a "quote" grabbed
from the file, where quotes are defined by text between $rand_quote_delim.

This looks for the quote-file first in the local (data) directory, then
relative to the top of the data directory, then in the local HTML directory,
then relative to the top of the HTML directory.

This creates a 'rand_quote' entry action, which should be placed after
'parse_entry' in the entry_action list and before 'render_entry'. If you are
using the Posy::Plugin::ShortBody plugin, this should be placed after
'short_body' in the entry_action list, not before it.


==   Configuration   ==

This expects configuration settings in the $self->{config} hash, which, in
the default Posy setup, can be defined in the main "config" file in the data
directory.

``rand_quote_delim''
The delimiter which defines quotes in the quote-file. (default: "%\n", which
is what is used in "fortune" data files)


==== REQUIRES ====
